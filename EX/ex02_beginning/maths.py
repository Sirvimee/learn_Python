Find the average of a, b, c and d, but first the numbers must be multiplied. a multiplied by 1, b multiplied by 2,
c multiplied by 3 and d multiplied by 4.
After the multiplication find the average of the numbers and print it out.

Example 1
a = 0
b = 0
c = 0
d = 4

Output
4

Example 2
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
d = 4
Output
7.5

Example 2
a = 5
b = 0
c = 5
d = 1

Output
6

Calculate the sum of two fractions.

One fraction is x/y where x and y are numbers given as input.
The other fraction is u/t where u and t are also numbers given as input.

Find and print the sum of x/y + u/t.

NB! the fraction does not have to be in the simplest form.
NB! the answer should be given as a string and should not contain any commas.

Example 1
x = 1
y = 3
u = 1
t = 3

Output
2/3 or 6/9 or 4/6

Example 2
x = 2
y = 5
u = 1
t = 5

Output
3/5
